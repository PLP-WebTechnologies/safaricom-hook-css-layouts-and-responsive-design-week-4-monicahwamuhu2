# Assignment: Responsive Web Design

## Objective:
Create a responsive webpage using modern CSS techniques, specifically Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries. The goal is to ensure the webpage adapts gracefully to various screen sizes.

## Assignment Tasks

### Designing a Responsive Layout

Header (including a logo and navigation links).
Main content area (with two columns: one for text content and the other for an image).

b. Use Flexbox to style the navigation menu in the header.
c. Use CSS Grid to structure the main content area.

### Creating Media Queries for Responsiveness
a. Implement media queries to ensure the webpage looks good on the following screen sizes:

Small screens (up to 600px): Stack all sections vertically.
Medium screens (601px to 1024px): Keep the header and footer horizontal, but stack the main content columns.
Large screens (above 1024px): Display the layout as designed with Flexbox and Grid.
